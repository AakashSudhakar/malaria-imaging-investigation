<h1 align="center">Code Structures (Project Template)</h1>

`TODO`: **Edit this document with updated information about code-based objects and data structures relevant for extensive project functionality.**

Important code structures include language-dependent objects and data structures needed for Jupyter or production-based functionality. 

Examples of relevant structures can include engines for preprocessing/processing data for the project's tutorialized notebooks or custom visualization algorithms using advanced frameworks like Plotly.
