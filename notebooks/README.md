`TODO`: **Edit this document with updated information about tutorialized project notebooks, including more details on each conditional notebook.**

Tutorialized project notebooks live here.

For an end-to-end data pipeline project, at least three key steps are involved: exploratory data analysis, intermediate data processing, and predictive data modeling. 

The _exploratory data analysis_ notebook entails data preprocessing and manipulation steps, including null value imputation and introductory data visualizations. 

The _intermediate data processing_ notebook details data processing and encoding steps, including data discretization and inferential statistical analysis. 

The _predictive data modeling_ notebook depicts machine learning and deep learning algorithm design and analysis.
