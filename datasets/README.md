`TODO`: **Edit this document with updated information about your relative datasets, including generalized information about your external, interim, and processed data.**

General project data lives here. 

Original project data and metadata can be accessed via [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria).

External project data is converted into raw data, curated into interim data, and further processed into processed data, which is then ready and available for machine learning and predictive analytics.
